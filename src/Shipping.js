        <p>In order to do this we do not automatically authorize and settle your Credit Card Orders while you are on our site. We pull, pack and weight your order before we run your card number. This lets us do two things, charge you the exact shipping cost and never charge your card before your order is ready to ship.</p>

        <p>We use UPS for heavier items, because it costs you less. If you can have your order sent to a "business" address, it will save you even more money.</p>

        <p>Most orders are shipped in 24 hours, except weekends and holidays. If your order will not be shipped in 48 hours you will emailed with an estimated shipping date.</p>

        <p>International customers will be contacted by email to approve shipping method and cost. Please monitor your email after ordering. Time in customs is ususally longer than shipping time. If you have not received your package 30 days after we tell you it will arrive in your country, estimated shipping time plus thirty days to clear customs, contact us and we will take the appropriate action. Due to greater risk and additional paper work, there will be an addtional 2% handling charge on international orders. You may be required to pay some duty/tax by your country's customs department.</p>

        <p>If you like our prices, products and service please tell all your volleyball friends about us.</p>
